        <h1>Data science</h1>
        <p>
          Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming,
          advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning
          with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights
          hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide
          decision making and strategic planning.The accelerating volume of data
          sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the
          fastest growing field across every industry. As a result, it is no
          surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed the “sexiest
          job of the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review (link resides
          outside of IBM). Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to
          interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve
          business outcomes.The data science lifecycle involves various roles,
          tools, and processes, which enables analysts to glean actionable
          insights

        <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or
          software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or other animals.
          It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies
          intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs. is widely used
          throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile
          applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search),
          recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix),
          understanding human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and
          Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools
          (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy
          games (such as chess and Go).Alan Turing was the first person to
          conduct substantial research in the field that he called Machine
          Intelligence.[2] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic
          discipline in 1956.[3] The field went through multiple cycles of
          optimism[4][5] followed by disappointment and loss of funding.[6][7]
          Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning
          surpassed all previous AI techniques,[8] and after 2017 with the
          transformer architecture.[9] This led to the AI spring of the early
          2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly
          based in the United States pioneering significant advances in
          artificial intelligenced
