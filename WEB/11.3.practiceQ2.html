          <h1>Charminar</h1>
          <p>
            The Charminar (lit.â€‰'four minarets') is a monument located in
            Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a
            symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of
            Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of
            a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both
            historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its
            popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has
            become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad.
            Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as
            Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main
            mosque, the Makkah Masjid.

          <h1>Golden Temple</h1>
          <p>
            The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in
            Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883
            and the 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966.
            In the early 1980s, the gurdwara became a centre of conflict between
            the Indian government and a radical movement led by Jarnail Singh
            Bhindranwale.[13] In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the
            Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, leading to deaths of
            more than 1,000 soldiers, militants and civilians, as well as
            causing much damage to the gurdwara and the destruction of Akal
            Takht. The gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.
