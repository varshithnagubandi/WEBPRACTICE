        and investor. He is the founder, chairman, CEO, and CTO of SpaceX; angel

        Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated
        net worth of US$232 billion as of December 2023, according to the
        Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $254 billion according to Forbes,
        primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.A member of the
        wealthy South African Musk family, Elon was born in Pretoria and briefly
        attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age
        18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years
        later, he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk
        later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received
        bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in
        1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two
        days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software
        company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in
        1999, and, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com
        merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.

        Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's
        administrative capital.[11][12] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch
        ancestry.[13][14] His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and
        dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South
        Africa.[15][16][17] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African
        electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property
        developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika,
        as well as a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature
        Reserve.[18][19][20][21] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a
        younger sister, Tosca.Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.[21]
        His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative
        of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children
        shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[11] His maternal
        grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took
        his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a
        single-engine Bellanca airplane.[23][24][25][26] After his parents
        divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.[13][18]
        Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his
        father.[27] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.

        Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High
        School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk
        was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a
        B on his senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian
        passport through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would
        be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting
        for his application to be processed, he attended the University of
        Pretoria for five months.Two years later, he transferred to the
        University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia,
        where he earned two degrees, a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a
        Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the university's Wharton
        School.[46][47][48][49] Although Musk said he earned the degrees in
        1995, the University of Pennsylvania maintains that they were awarded in
        1997.[50] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay
        for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning
        service similar to Google Books.
